#ifndef fmiModelFunctions_h
#define fmiModelFunctions_h

/* This header file must be utilized when compiling a model.
   It defines all functions of the Model Execution Interface.
   In order to have unique function names even if several models
   are compiled together (e.g. for embedded systems), every "real" function name
   is constructed by prepending the function name by
   "MODEL_IDENTIFIER" + "_" where "MODEL_IDENTIFIER" is the short name
   of the model used as the name of the zip-file where the model is stored.
   Therefore, the typical usage is:

      #define MODEL_IDENTIFIER MyModel
      #include "fmiModelFunctions.h"

   As a result, a function that is defined as "fmiGetDerivatives" in this header file,
   is actually getting the name "MyModel_fmiGetDerivatives".

   Revisions:
   - Jan. 20, 2010: stateValueReferencesChanged added to struct fmiEventInfo (ticket #27)
                    (by M. Otter, DLR)
                    Added WIN32 pragma to define the struct layout (ticket #34)
                    (by J. Mauss, QTronic)
   - Jan.  4, 2010: Removed argument intermediateResults from fmiInitialize
                    Renamed macro fmiGetModelFunctionsVersion to fmiGetVersion
                    Renamed macro fmiModelFunctionsVersion to fmiVersion
                    Replaced fmiModel by fmi1Component in decl of fmiInstantiateModel
                    (by J. Mauss, QTronic)
   - Dec. 17, 2009: Changed extension "me" to "fmi" (by Martin Otter, DLR).
   - Dez. 14, 2009: Added eventInfo to meInitialize and added
                    meGetNominalContinuousStates (by Martin Otter, DLR)
   - Sept. 9, 2009: Added DllExport (according to Peter Nilsson's suggestion)
                    (by A. Junghanns, QTronic)
   - Sept. 9, 2009: Changes according to FMI-meeting on July 21:
                    meInquireModelTypesVersion     -> meGetModelTypesPlatform
                    meInquireModelFunctionsVersion -> meGetModelFunctionsVersion
                    meSetStates                    -> meSetContinuousStates
                    meGetStates                    -> meGetContinuousStates
                    removal of meInitializeModelClass
                    removal of meGetTime
                    change of arguments of meInstantiateModel
                    change of arguments of meCompletedIntegratorStep
                    (by Martin Otter, DLR):
   - July 19, 2009: Added "me" as prefix to file names (by Martin Otter, DLR).
   - March 2, 2009: Changed function definitions according to the last design
                    meeting with additional improvements (by Martin Otter, DLR).
   - Dec. 3 , 2008: First version by Martin Otter (DLR) and Hans Olsson (Dynasim).
